## Terraform resource group
# Use "terraform init" to initialize the terraform resources.
# To create resource, we should use "terraform plan" and "terraform apply" command.
# To destroy the resource, use "terraform destroy" command.
# Never ever share .tfstate file, it contains sensitive information.
# Terraform interpolation using resource group and virtual network
# "terraform apply -auto-approve" command should be used if we want to create resource without asking for the confirmation.
